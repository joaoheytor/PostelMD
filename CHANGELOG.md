# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Before 1.0, breaking changes bump the minor version (see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Foundation documents: PRD, architecture, ADRs 0001–0018, threat model, roadmap, CI/CD
  design, and governance files (Apache-2.0 license, DCO, Code of Conduct, security policy).
- The web app, embedded in the binary: first-run setup with the server's token, login, a file
  tree to open, create and delete notes and folders, and a CodeMirror 6 editor that autosaves
  with `If-Match` and shows a conflict instead of overwriting an edit made elsewhere.
